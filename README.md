# Code-Refactor

## Project Description

This project was a homework assignment that was designed to simulate an on-the-job ticket. I was given existing code that I needed to modify and refactor to meet the client's standards. In this homework assigment, the client was looking for me to refactor their existing site to make it more accessible. 

## Installation

To install this project, simply download the attached [index.html](./index.html) and [style.css](./assets/css/style.css) files. All code was edited by using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) which is free to download. 

## Usage

## Credits

A lot of the knowledge on how to do this assigment came from class instruction, but I also consulted a number of third-party assets for help. First, I used [W3 Schools'](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_semantic_elements.asp) article on HTML Semantic Elements. I also watched [NetNinja's HTML and CSS Crash Course YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGW8Al_cga4) which detailed HTML5 Semantics. Finally, I had help from my tutor [Bobby Hoffman](https://github.com/rhoffman103), who was able to assist me in coming up with the correct semantic elements for my HTML code.
