# Code-Refactor

## Project Description

This project was a homework assignment that was designed to simulate an on-the-job ticket. I was given existing code that I needed to modify and refactor to meet the client's standards. In this homework assigment, the client was looking for me to refactor their existing site to make it more accessible. 

## Installation

To install this project, simply download the attached [index.html](https://github.com/andrewbreen/code-refactor/commit/72a735a6f8d85197a12a47873f4f784ef6416414) and [style.css](https://github.com/andrewbreen/code-refactor/commit/31d22dd8bc0acb5738b75fdb38e37acc826fbe4e) files. All code was edited by using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) which is free to download. 

## Usage

The purpose of this assignment was for me to better understand the difference between semantic html elements and non-semantic html elements. That being said, if you wish to use this project and test your knowledge, you first need to download the provided index.html and style.css files in the installation section, which were the original files provided to me by my instructors. Replace the non-semantic html elements with more descriptive elements without disrupting the functionality of the website. This is what the final project should look like:

## Credits

A lot of the knowledge on how to do this assigment came from class instruction, but I also consulted a number of third-party assets for help. First, I used [W3 Schools'](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_semantic_elements.asp) article on HTML Semantic Elements. I also watched [NetNinja's HTML and CSS Crash Course YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGW8Al_cga4) which detailed HTML5 Semantics. Finally, I had help from my tutor [Bobby Hoffman](https://github.com/rhoffman103), who was able to assist me in coming up with the correct semantic elements for my HTML code.
